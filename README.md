# Remind-inator!

**Version Alpha_0.1.3**

For those moments when you really need something to keep you going, behold the Remind-inator!

The goal of this project is to provide a simple tool that forces you to do what needs to be done. 

For me at least, I find it very hard to chose what to do. It can be overwhelming to look at a long to do list and not know where to start. Remind-inator is a helpful tool that helps keep the stress of looking at a to do list far away and focuses on individual tasks, reminding you periodicly what you should be focusing on right now.

## Usage:

#### Step 1:
Fill in the given TODO.csv using a text editor, or upload it into a Google Sheets, and then redownload it after it's filled in
#### Step 2:
Run sqlSetup.py (the filled in TODO.csv must be called exactly that, and must be in the same directory as the sqlSetup.py)
#### Step 3:
In a terminal, `pip install pyttsx3`
#### Step 4:
Run main.py whenever you need to use it. You can pause a task at anytime by pressing Entre in the terminal running main.py. Quit using the quit option when a task is paused.

#### Debugging:
##### linux:
If running main.py returns an error, then `sudo apt update && sudo apt install espeak ffmpeg libespeak1` in a terminal
##### pyttsx3 install error
If you get installation errors , make sure you first upgrade your wheel version using :
`pip install --upgrade wheel`
