# Remind-inator!

For those moments when you really need something to keep you going, behold the Remind-inator!

The goal of this project is to provide a simple tool that forces you to do what needs to be done. 

For me at least, I find it very hard to chose what to do. It can be overwhelming to look at a long to do list and not know where to start. Remind-inator is a helpful tool that helps keep the stress of looking at a to do list far away and focuses on individual tasks, reminding you periodicly what you should be focusing on right now.
