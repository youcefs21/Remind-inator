# Remind-inator!

**Version Alpha_0.1.1**

For those moments when you really need something to keep you going, behold the Remind-inator!

The goal of this project is to provide a simple tool that forces you to do what needs to be done. This is my first ever project that I am planning to commit to long term.

## Usage:

#### Step 1:
Fill in the given TODO.csv by using a text editor, or uploading it into a Google Sheets, and then redownload it after it's filled in
#### Step 2:
Run sqlSetup.py
#### Step 3:
Run main.py when ever you need to use it. There is currently no exit function, so you'll just have to terminate the program during the prompt that asks you if you can do the given task. Terminating at any other point will cause lose in data.

The program is currently meant to be run in a linux terminal, and is not expected to work anywhere else. It will eventually be converted to a website when out of alpha.
